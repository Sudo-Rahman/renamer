# Renamer

My first try, to create an application and sell licences for it.
A simple file renamer, that can rename multiple files at once.

## Features

- Rename multiple files at once
- Multiple renaming options (add prefix/suffix, replace text, change case, etc.)
- Preview changes before renaming
- Save and load renaming profiles
- User-friendly interface
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Lightweight and fast

## Technologies Used

- Tauri v2 (for building the desktop application)
- Rust (for backend logic, for API)
- Sveletkit (for dektop frontend UI, for website)
- TypeScript (for frontend logic)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
